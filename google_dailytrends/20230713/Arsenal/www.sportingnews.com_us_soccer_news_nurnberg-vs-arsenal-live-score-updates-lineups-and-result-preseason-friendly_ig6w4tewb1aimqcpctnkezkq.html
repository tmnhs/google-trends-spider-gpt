<p>Although everyone was watching Havertz closely, it was no surprise that Bukayo Saka took the spotlight again as he scored with his curling effort early on in the match.</p>

<p>Folarin Balogun missed two good opportunities after he came on in the second half whereas Ethan Nwaneri made a very positive impact off the bench. 16-year-old Myles Lewis-Skelly was also given some minutes late on in the fixture.</p>

<p>With Matt Turner on international, Karl Hein had an opportunity to impress Mikel Arteta. Unfortunately for the Estonian goalkeeper, his error led to the Nurnberg equaliser in the second period.</p>

<p>Nurnberg are now unbeaten in four preseason matches while Arsenal will face the MLS All-Stars on July 19 before friendlies with Man United and Barcelona in the United States.</p>

<p><strong>90 min</strong>: HUGE MISS! Balogun has an incredible chance to score in the final minute of the match, but he hits the side-netting after taking it around the goalkeeper! Big chance missed from the Arsenal forward.</p>

<p><strong>89 min</strong>: Arsenal are hit on the counter-attack again, but Castrop fails to test Hein with his effort. The Nurnberg fans are growing in volume as they try to help their side find a late winner.</p>

<p><strong>87 min</strong>: Nwaneri produces a brilliant piece of skill to beat two players. The 16-year-old has been making a good impact in this second half.</p>

<p><strong>84 min</strong>: Arsenal are being pressed well by the Nurnberg attackers as they struggle to get the ball into the final third. They are committing more players forward when attacking, leaving themselves open for a counter-attack.</p>

<p><strong>82 min</strong>: Walters has a half-chance for Arsenal as he gets on the end of Cedric's corner, but his header goes wide of the target.</p>

<p><strong>80 min</strong>: Castrop's effort from range goes flying over the crossbar as Nurnberg continue to put pressure on the Arsenal goal. </p>

<p>The Gunners are failing to combine well in the final third due to all the substitutions made in the second half.</p>

<p><strong>77 min</strong>: Walters comes on for White while Lewis-Skelly replaces Nketiah. Arteta has now used up all his substitutions in this match.</p>

<p><strong>74 min: </strong>CROSSBAR! Nurnberg almost take the lead against all odds, but Hubner is denied by the woodwork.</p>

<p>Loune's thunderous strike is parried by Hein, which allows Hubner to get on the end of the rebound. The Arsenal goalkeeper could only watch the ball as it bounced on his crossbar.</p>

<p><strong>73 min</strong>: The game has become a lot more end-to-end since the Nurnberg equaliser. Neither side seem happy to settle for a draw as they both push for a winner.</p>

<p><strong>71 min</strong>: Trusty is shown a yellow card by the referee as he commits a foul near the halfway line in order to stop a dangerous attack.</p>

<p><strong>69 min</strong>: Nurnberg make wholesale changes as all their remaining substitutes are now on the pitch. This could slow the pace of the game down for a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>66 min</strong>: The unexpected Nurnberg goal has given the German second division side a bit more confidence as they look to play more positive passes.</p>

<p>Arteta won't be happy with how his side conceded, but this is a good test for the Gunners.</p>

<p><strong>63 min: GOAL! Nurnberg 1-1 Arsenal</strong> (Okunuki)</p>

<p>Nurnberg have an equaliser after Hein takes an unnecessary risk at the back. He tries to find Jorginho with a pass, but Okunuki gets there first a sends the ball into an empty net.</p>

<p><strong>61 min</strong>: POST! Balogun hits the woodwork from a very tight angle after taking the ball around the goalkeeper. He will be disappointed with himself there.</p>

<p><strong>60 min</strong>: Nwaneri and Trusty now come off the bench for Vieira and Gabriel.</p>

<p><strong>59 min</strong>: Vieira and Cedric combine down the right flank before the latter tries to find the far corner with a curling effort, but the defender's shot goes wide of the left post.</p>

<p><strong>56 min</strong>: Balogun now comes on Trossard, who picks up a small knock. It is no surprise that Arteta does not want to take a risk with any of his players.</p>

<p><strong>54 min</strong>: Jesus misses a huge chance for Arsenal! He is one-on-one with the goalkeeper after a long-throw from Tierney, but the striker misses the target with a left-footed attempt.</p>

<p><strong>52 min</strong>: Arsenal are controlling possession to begin this second period as Nurnberg are struggling to even get close to their opponents.</p>

<p><strong>49 min</strong>: It is a tense start at the second half as Marquez is shown a yellow card a for bad challenge. Both sides will want to match the intensity at which they played the first period.</p>

<p><strong>46 min</strong>: Havertz comes on at half-time for his first Arsenal appearance. Jesus, Cedric, Jorginho, Hein and Tierney all join the Germany international for the second half.</p>

<p>Klaus and Goller replace Mathenia and Duah at the break for Nurnberg.</p>

<p><strong>Half-time: Nurnberg 0-1 Arsenal</strong></p>

<p>After two additional minutes at the end of the first half, both sides go in for a 15 minute break.</p>

<p>Arsenal have looked very strong since taking the lead in the seventh minute of the match. The right side of Saka and White has been difficult to contain for the Nurnberg defenders.</p>

<p>A lot of changes will be expected at the half-time break.</p>

<p><strong>45 min</strong>: White has been a big threat for Arsenal down the right-hand side. He is constantly providing an overlapping run, which also allows Saka to move inside and create another passing option.</p>

<p><strong>42 min</strong>: Nurnberg are trying to increase the intensity now as they try look find a way to equalise before half-time. Arsenal however are keeping possession in a professional manner.</p>

<p><strong>39 min</strong>: Arsenal are showing how they could set up in the upcoming season. Trossard is playing a similar role to which Xhaka operated last year, something that Havertz could be tasked with in this side.</p>

<p><strong>36 min</strong>: The tempo of the match is now considerably slower since the drinks break. Arsenal are just keeping possession around the halfway line as they look to see their lead through to the break.</p>

<p><strong>33 min</strong>: Ramsdale puts Partey into a difficult situation after the goalkeeper's pass is intercepted quickly. The Arsenal midfielder makes a tactical foul to stop the danger.</p>

<p><strong>30 min</strong>: Both managers have a quick conversation with their players as Saka stays down following an awkward landing. The Arsenal fans in the stadium start clapping to show their appreciation for the winger, who is now back on his feet.</p>

<p><strong>28 min</strong>: Like Zinchenko did last season, Kiwior is moving into a central midfield role when Arsenal are on the ball. This is giving Partey help when the Gunners are looking to move the ball forward.</p>

<p><strong>25 min</strong>: Both Nelson and Saka are showing that their fitness levels are very good as they both track back to help their full-backs defend. Ramsdale is yet to be tested in goal.</p>

<p><strong>22 min</strong>: Saka nearly gets a second goal, but Mathenia makes a good save to his left. Nketiah tees his team-mate up for a first-time shot and the goal scorer connects well with the ball.</p>

<p>Mathenia is not getting a lot of help from his defenders at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>20 min</strong>: Arsenal are dominating possession now as they force Nurnberg towards their own goal. The Premier League side are moving the ball quickly to try and break their opponents down.</p>

<p><strong>17 min</strong>: Partey tries his luck from close to 30 yards out, but his attempt flies over the bar of the Nurnberg goal. Arsenal are growing stronger in this match as the minutes tick by.</p>

<p><strong>14 min</strong>: Nelson manages to win a corner for Arsenal as Mathenia tips the deflected strike over the bar. Saka's in-swinging corner is punched away by the goalkeeper.</p>

<p><strong>11 min</strong>: Nurnberg are trying to respond with a goal of their own, but they are playing too quick for their own good. Arsenal look quite comfortable when they are defending in their own half.</p>

<p><strong>7 min: GOAL - Nurnberg 0-1 Arsenal (Bukayo Saka)</strong></p>

<p>Arsenal take the lead as Saka scores a fantastic goal from the edge of the box! He cuts the ball onto his left foot and curls his effort beyond Mathenia and into the far corner.</p>

<p><strong>6 min</strong>: Vieira has the first shot of the match as the ball fall to him near the penalty spot, but he scuffs his shot wide with his weaker foot.</p>

<p><strong>4 min</strong>: Arsenal are doing a lot of defending in the early stages of this match as it is clear that Nurnberg are few games into their preseason schedule whereas the Gunners play their first game today.</p>

<p><strong>1 min</strong>: Nurnberg are keeping the ball well from kickoff while Arsenal are trying to press their German counterparts high up the pitch.</p>

<p><strong>2 mins to kickoff</strong>: The players are on the pitch and ready to get the match underway! Gabriel is wearing the armband for Arsenal instead of Odegaard, who picked up a knock in the warm-up and is replaced by Fabio Vieira.</p>

<p><strong>30 mins to kickoff</strong>: Arsenal's Premier League campaign starts on August 12 with a home fixture against Nottingham Forest. They will also face Man City on August 6 in the FA Community Shield.</p>

<p>Arteta will be hoping for a fully fit squad for both of those fixtures.</p>
