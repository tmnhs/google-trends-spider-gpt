<p>Hold on to your hats, folks! The U.S. government has just announced that Social Security benefits are getting a 2 percent boost in 2018. That means an extra $27 in the pockets of the average recipient, whose monthly check is currently $1,258. </p>
<p>This is big news, people! It's been ages since the government has given such a generous increase. And with over 66 million Americans relying on Social Security, this bump in benefits could mean the difference between scraping by and living comfortably. </p>
<p>In fact, Social Security is the government's biggest weapon in the fight against poverty. Last year alone, it kept a whopping 26 million Americans from falling below the poverty line. That's some serious superhero stuff right there. </p>
<p>Of course, those who are already receiving benefits are thrilled about the news. "We need more money to live on," says Sandy Lacoss, a retired cleaner from Woodstock, VT. "My rent goes up every year. I really can't afford it." </p>
<p>So let's all give a round of applause to Social Security for being the hero we need (and deserve). And if you're lucky enough to be a recipient, go ahead and treat yourself to something nice with that extra $27. You've earned it!
Meet Lacoss, a 71-year-old woman who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and dizziness. Her doctors advised her to get a medical alert system, but her low pension and Social Security checks make it difficult to afford one. Lacoss' yearly income of $12,060 puts her just below the poverty line.</p>

<p>Back in 2009, Congress approved President Barack Obama's request for an extra $250 one-time payment for Social Security recipients. However, since the 2-percent raise in 2011, checks haven't seen much of an increase. In 2017, the raise was only 0.3 percent, and in 2016, there was no raise at all.</p>
<p>Raises are supposed to help with the rising costs of living, but the Cost-Of-Living Adjustment (COLA) often falls short for those receiving Social Security. It's a tough situation for people like Lacoss who are struggling to make ends meet.
As we grow older, we rely more on social security benefits to cover our expenses. But did you know that the cost of living adjustment (COLA) for these benefits may not be keeping up with our actual costs? According to Gary Koenig, the Vice President of Financial Security for AARP, many seniors feel that the COLA is not enough.</p>
<p>This is causing seniors to dip into their savings more quickly, which can negatively impact their lifetime income. Mary Johnson, an advocate from The Senior Citizens League, warns that years of no COLA increase can have long-lasting effects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some experts believe that the 40-year-old formula used to calculate the COLA is still effective. Charles Blahous, a former public trustee for Social Security and Medicare, argues that seniors are not being slighted.</p>
<p>Regardless of where you stand on the issue, it's important to stay informed about the impact of COLA on social security benefits. After all, we all want to enjoy our golden years without financial stress!

Hey there, high schoolers! Let me break down some important info about COLA (Cost of Living Adjustment) for you. Basically, it's a way to make sure that senior citizens get enough money to keep up with the rising costs of living. </p>
<p>Now, some years the COLA doesn't increase, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It just means that the amount of money seniors are getting stays the same. But in 2018, the COLA did increase, and that's because of some pretty crazy stuff that happened - Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma caused gas prices and other things to go up, which made it more expensive for everyone to live. </p>
<p>The way they figure out how much the COLA should be is by looking at something called the CPI-W (Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers). Basically, they measure how much things cost from July to September, and then compare it to the same time period from the year before. That's how they figure out if the COLA needs to go up or not. </p>
<p>So there you have it, folks! Now you know a little bit more about how the COLA works. Stay tuned for more exciting info!</p>
